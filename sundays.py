# Jack is always excited about sunday. It is favourite day, when he gets to play all day. And goes to 
# cycling with his friends.
# So every time when the months starts he counts the number of sundays he will get to enjoy. 
# Considering the month can start with any day, be it Sunday, Mondayâ€¦. Or so on.
# Count the number of Sunday jack will get within n number of days.
